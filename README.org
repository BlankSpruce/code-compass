This package shall guide you in your software development within
Emacs. For example, it will point at the code that requires your
changes the most and it will suggest you who to ask for help when you
are lost.

I have presented some of the capabilities of *code-compass* in [[https://emacsconf.org/2020/talks/24/][this
talk of EmacsConf2020]].
